# Vending machine (PHP console script)
Following PSR, OOP, and SOLID principles, create a CLI script (console command) that will work as a vending machine (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vending_machine)
Your vending machine should have:
1. Display a list of products and their prices:
   - Coca-cola 1.50
   - Snickers 1.20
   - Lay's 2.00
2. Allow selection of a product and display its price.
3. Accept coins from the customer with the following denominations:
   - 0.01
   - 0.05
   - 0.10
   - 0.25
   - 0.50
   - 1.00
4. Check if the coin can be accepted.
